Effect of Image Permutation on CNNs
In this project, we investigate how image permutation impacts the performance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) such as GoogLeNet, AlexNet, ResNet-16, and others in the task of image classification.

The accompanying files document our entire process, including insights, various evaluations, and tuning procedures conducted to test the limits of performance.
