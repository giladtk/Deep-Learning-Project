Effect of Image Permutation on CNNs
In this project, we investigate how image permutation impacts the performance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) such as GoogLeNet, AlexNet, ResNet-16, and others in the task of image classification.

The accompanying files document our entire process, including insights, various evaluations, and tuning procedures conducted to test the limits of performance.

what is image premutation ?
